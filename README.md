### About
- This tool creates a SampleSheet **which has least information** required to basecall and demultiplex bcl in bcl2fastq, NS2000/1000 (Dragen) and LocalRunManager in iSeq100.
- The software consists of static html/css and javascript codes.
- Basic usage is just copy&paste sample IDs arranged as plate position in Excel to the textbox.
- Created SampleSheet can be used to bcl2fastq or import to illumina machines.
- Currently, not all illumina machines are supported and check whether the generated SampleSheet is valid to your platform.
